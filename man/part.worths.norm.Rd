\item{ratings}{a data frame with all clients' ratings}

\item{bundles}{a data frame with all product profiles rated by clients}

\item{standard}{whether we should standaridized clientes ratings. Default equal to FALSE (0)}

\description{
This function computes the partworth of attribute levels for each
  respondent. It uses treatment effects; ratings is a matrix of clients
  (rows) by bundles rated (colums); bundles is a matrix of
  bundles (rows) by attributes (colums).
  This function computes the partworth of attribute levels for each
  respondent But transform coefficient so that the sum of part worths
  for each attribute is zero Uses treatment effects ratings is a matrix
  of clients (rows) by bundles rated (colums) bundles is a
  matrix of bundles (rows) by attributes (colums) If standard is 1,
  then parth worths are normalized read in conjoint survey profiles
  with respondent ranks
